    <h1 class="detail-title">AI and Statistics</h1>
    <p class="detail-description">AI (Artificial Intelligence) is one of the most important and fastest-growing fields of technology today. Applications of AI are becoming ubiquitous, and solutions learned from data are increasingly displacing traditional hand-crafted algorithms. Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) are major branches of artificial intelligence (AI) that provide systems with the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.</p>
     
    <p class="detail-description">This tutorial explores the fundamental theory and practical engineering of various Machine Learning and Deep Learning models, including classic algorithms like SVM, Decision Trees, and Naive Bayesian, as well as advanced architectures such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), and Transformers. We will also demonstrate how to train and apply these models across diverse real-world applications.</p>
    
    <p class="detail-description">Serving as the **major foundational tool**, Statistics underpins the entire scope of this tutorial.</p>
    
    <p class="detail-description">Both Machine Learning and Deep Learning follow a pipeline structure to create and deploy AI-based systems. The pipeline commonly has the following form:</p>

    <h2 style="margin-top: 30px;">The ML Pipeline</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>**Data Ingestion:** Gathering and loading data from various sources (databases, APIs, files).</li>
        <li>**Preprocessing:** Cleaning the data, handling missing values, and dealing with inconsistencies.</li>
        <li>**Feature Engineering:** Transforming raw data into features that better represent the underlying problem to the predictive models.</li>
        <li>**Model Training:** Feeding the prepared data to the chosen algorithm (like Decision Trees or SVM) to learn patterns.</li>
        <li>**Evaluation:** Testing the model's performance on unseen data to ensure accuracy and robustness.</li>
        <li>**Deployment:** Integrating the model into a live environment where it can make real-time predictions.</li>
    </ul>
