typical pipeline for training transformer models with the Datasets, Tokenizers, and Transformers
libraries

Although Datasets provides a lot of low-level functionality to slice and dice our data, it is
often convenient to convert a Dataset object to a Pandas DataFrame so we can access
high-level APIs for data visualization

Whenever you are working on text classification problems, it is a good idea to examine the
distribution of examples across the classes. A dataset with a skewed class distribution might
require a different treatment in terms of the training loss and evaluation metrics than a balanced
one.There are several ways to deal with imbalanced data, including:
Randomly oversample the minority class.
Randomly undersample the majority class.
Gather more labeled data from the underrepresented classes.

Tokenization is the step of
breaking down a string into the atomic units used in the model. character Tokenization,word Tokenization

The architecture used for sequence classification with an encoder-based transformer; it consists of the model’s
pretrained body combined with a custom classification head
