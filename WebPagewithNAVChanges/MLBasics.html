    <h1 class="detail-title">ML Basics: Generative vs. Discriminative Models</h1>
    
    <p class="detail-description">
        In machine learning, supervised learning models can generally be split into two main categories based on how they approach the relationship between the input data ($X$) and the labels ($Y$). 
    </p>

    <div class="grid-list">
        <div class="grid-item">
            <span class="tag" style="background-color: #e67e22;">Discriminative Models</span>
            <h3>The "Boundary" Finders</h3>
            <p class="detail-description">
                Discriminative models learn the <strong>decision boundary</strong> between classes. They model the conditional probability $P(Y|X)$.
            </p>
            <ul class="model-list">
                <li>Logistic Regression</li>
                <li>Support Vector Machines (SVM)</li>
                <li>Neural Networks</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="grid-item">
            <span class="tag" style="background-color: #27ae60;">Generative Models</span>
            <h3>The "Distribution" Builders</h3>
            <p class="detail-description">
                Generative models learn the <strong>underlying distribution</strong> of the data. They model the joint probability $P(X, Y)$.
            </p>
            <ul class="model-list">
                <li>Naive Bayes</li>
                <li>Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)</li>
                <li>GANs</li>
            </ul>

    <h2 class="detail-title">Ensemble Learning</h2>
    <p class="detail-description">
        <strong>Ensemble Learning</strong> is a strategic approach where multiple models (often called "weak learners") are combined to solve a single problem. The core idea is that a collection of models will perform better, be more robust, and have less error than any individual model alone.
    </p>

    

    <h3>Primary Ensemble Techniques</h3>
    <div class="grid-list">
        <div class="grid-item" style="border-top-color: #9b59b6;">
            <span class="tag" style="background-color: #9b59b6;">Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating)</span>
            <p class="detail-description">
                Builds multiple independent models in parallel using different subsets of the data and averages their predictions. This helps <strong>reduce variance</strong> (overfitting).
            </p>
            <strong>Example:</strong> Random Forest.
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item" style="border-top-color: #e74c3c;">
            <span class="tag" style="background-color: #e74c3c;">Boosting</span>
            <p class="detail-description">
                Builds models sequentially. Each new model attempts to correct the errors made by the previous ones. This helps <strong>reduce bias</strong>.
            </p>
            <strong>Examples:</strong> AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost.
        </div>

        <h3>Why use Ensembles?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> They generally provide higher predictive performance than single models.</li>
            <li><strong>Robustness:</strong> They are less sensitive to noise in the training data.</li>
            <li><strong>Reliability:</strong> They reduce the risk of choosing a poor-performing individual model.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <p class="detail-description">
        Think of Ensemble Learning like a "Wisdom of the Crowd" effect. While one expert might make a mistake, the average opinion of a hundred experts is much more likely to be correct.
