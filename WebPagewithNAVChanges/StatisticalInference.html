<h2 style="margin-top: 40px;">Statistical Inference and Parameter Estimation</h2>
<p class="detail-description">
    Statistical inference is the process of drawing conclusions about an underlying population based on a finite sample of data. In the framework of <strong>Parametric Estimation</strong>, we assume that the population data follows a known probability distribution family (such as the Gaussian or Poisson distribution), which is characterized by a fixed but unknown set of parameters, denoted as <strong>&theta;</strong>. The goal is to calculate an estimate, <strong>&theta;&#770;</strong> (theta-hat), using the sample data.
</p>

<p class="detail-description">
    A common assumption in this framework is that the data points <em>x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>, ..., x<sub>n</sub></em> are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) drawn from a <strong>Normal Population</strong>, denoted as <strong>X ~ N(&mu;, &sigma;<sup>2</sup>)</strong>. Here, the unknown parameters are the population mean <strong>&mu;</strong> and the population variance <strong>&sigma;<sup>2</sup></strong>.

<p class="detail-description">
    Estimation is generally divided into two types:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Point Estimation:</strong> Providing a single value as the "best guess" for the parameter. For a Normal population, the Sample Mean (<strong>x&#772;</strong>) is often used as the unbiased point estimator for the population mean (<strong>&mu;</strong>).
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Interval Estimation:</strong> Constructing a range of values (Confidence Interval) within which the true parameter <strong>&theta;</strong> is expected to lie with a certain probability (e.g., 95%), acknowledging the uncertainty inherent in sampling.
    </li>
</ul>

    <strong>Example: Estimating the Average Height of Adult Men</strong>
    <p>
        Imagine we want to determine the average height of all adult men in a country (the <strong>Population</strong>). Since it is impossible to measure millions of individuals, the true population mean (<strong>&mu;</strong>) remains unknown.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>The Sample:</strong> We randomly select and measure 1,000 men.</li>
        <li><strong> The Data:</strong> We calculate the average height of this specific group, resulting in a <em>sample mean</em> (<strong>x&#772;</strong>) of 175 cm.</li>
        <li><strong>The Inference:</strong> Based on this limited data, we infer that the true average height of the entire population is likely close to 175 cm. Using interval estimation, we might conclude with 95% confidence that the true population mean <strong>&mu;</strong> lies between 174 cm and 176 cm.</li>
    </ul>
