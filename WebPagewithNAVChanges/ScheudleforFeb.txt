Schedule for February 2026.
Plan and its steps

1. Study Training (DL and LLM-based) Until Onam 2026. Update the already written notes (handwritten notes in ML Diary)
2. Read the Attention, Optimization, and NL part from d2l-en.pdf. Print out these chapters and do the second part of step1
3. Read PD, ML basics of DL book by Ian GoodFellow and do the second part of step1. Also, read the Hugging Face Book and do the second part of step1.
4. Complete the Webpage coding for ND,Random Variable, and also start coding for the Shallow network part of the webpage
5. Complete the design part of the Webpage(removing redundancy in reference part) and also update the contents (left vertical bar)
		Finalize the tutorials contents before end of Feb.
6. Test webpages using the localhost server
7. Normal Distribution/Sampling (Small and Large Sampling)/Neyman Pearson 
8. Improve Random Variable Expectations by adding the following stuffs
		1. Add Conditional Distributions
		2. Marginal Distributions
		3. Cumulative Distributions
		4. MGF as a special kind of Expectations
9. A page for inequalities in probabilities (Chebysebve)and convergence of Random variables or we can make it part of sampling distributions? 		

Next month 
Deep learning
CNN - Need explanation and description for training.
RNN - LSTM Training Network explanation 


Add (1) Cumulative Distributions (2) Marginal Distributions (3) MGF as an extension to Expectations
Add a Normal curve showing mu +-sigma,mu +- 2*sigma,mu +- 3*sigma.
Multivariate Distribution and
